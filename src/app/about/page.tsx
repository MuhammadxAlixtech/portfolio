      <p>
        Hi, I’m Muhammad Ali! I’m a B.Tech graduate in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning with a passion for building things that make an impact. My interests lie in AI, machine learning, blockchain, and quantum computing, and I’m always curious about how new technologies can solve real-world problems. I also have a strong background in competitive programming — I’ve reached the Expert rank on Codeforces (with a highest global rank of 583 and India rank of 5) and earned a 4-Star rating on Codechef — which has helped me develop sharp problem-solving skills and a persistent, creative approach to challenges.
